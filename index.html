        <h1>Managing Your Digital Identity</h1>
        <p>Every photo, comment, and post you make contributes to your digital identity. 
        Employers, schools, and strangers can make opinions based on what you share. 
        Managing your digital identity means being aware of how your actions affect your reputation,
        privacy, and security</p>
        <h2>What is a digital footprint</h2>
        <p>Your activity online both in what you post and what others share about you</p>
        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>A strong positive digital identity can open doors while a careless one can close
        them and potentially cause security and privacy threats</p>
